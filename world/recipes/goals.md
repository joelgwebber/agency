We are crafting a world for a hard science-fiction setting. I would like to construct an environment where humans live in a late-feudal society, but one that has grown from the remains of many layers of past civilizations that have risen and fallen over millennia.

The physical location is left intentionally ambiguous. Beyond fact that the characters are human, whose cultures are very distantly descended from scraps of real human cultures, it could be Earth, or post-Terran humans on another planet. The time period is also left ambiguous; it could be a few thousand years in the future, or tens of thousands. At least enough time for several worldwide cultures to rise and fall, along with their languages, knowledge, technologies, and artifacts.

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." We will use this famous observation as a guiding principle for our setting. We wish to conceive a world of deep mystery and wonder, but based entirely upon physically plausible principles. This mystery will be magnified by the fact that each of the cultures that rose and fell before, all learned imperfectly from those that came before, and left behind still more complex and inscrutable relics.
