The Aelvath language is called 'Aelstrom', a melodic language that reflects the rhythm of the river. It is a language of whispers and murmurs, with a soft, flowing cadence. It is a language that is well-suited to storytelling and music, and it is said to have a calming effect on those who hear it. It is known as [[Flowsong]] to outside cultures. The Aelvath territory, [[Aelvyr]], is named in this language.
