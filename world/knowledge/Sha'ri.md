The Sha'ri are a nomadic people who live in the vast deserts that surround the Nusantara's forest. They are skilled in survival and navigation, and they are known for their strong sense of community and their deep respect for the desert. They see themselves as guardians of the desert, and they are fiercely protective of their territory. They are intrigued by the Nusantara's connection to the forest, but they are also wary of their isolation and their resistance to change.
