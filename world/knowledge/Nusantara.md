The Nusantara are deeply connected to the forest, viewing it as a living entity that provides for them. They have a complex system of sustainable harvesting and replanting, guided by ancient wisdom passed down through generations. While they're communal within their settlements, they're wary of outsiders, believing that foreign influence could disrupt their delicate balance with nature. The Nusantari language is called Bahasalani.
