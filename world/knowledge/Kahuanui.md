The people of Kahuanui (meaning "great grove" in a derivation of Hawaiian) belong to the Nusantara culture. This village is fairly isolated, in a high-elevation, temperate cloud-forest environment.

It is primarily an agrarian village, relying on terraced farming and found technology to provide for themselves.
