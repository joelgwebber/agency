Neo-Riemannian music theory builds upon and interacts with other music theories in several ways:

* **Relationship to Traditional Tonal Theory:** Neo-Riemannian theory can be seen as an extension of traditional tonal theory, but it focuses more on the relationships between chords rather than their function within a key. It provides a different lens for analyzing tonal music, particularly chromatic progressions.  For example, while traditional tonal theory might analyze a chord progression in terms of its function (tonic, dominant, subdominant), neo-Riemannian theory would focus on the transformations between the chords, such as the "parallel" or "relative" relationships.  This approach can be particularly helpful in understanding chromatic progressions, which often involve chords that don't fit neatly into traditional functional categories.  (See, for example, Cohn, 1998). 

* **Connection to Schenkerian Analysis:**  While neo-Riemannian theory focuses on surface-level chord relationships, Schenkerian analysis delves deeper into the underlying structure of tonal music.  There are connections between the two, as neo-Riemannian transformations can sometimes be seen as reflecting Schenkerian voice-leading patterns.  For example, the "L" transformation in neo-Riemannian theory, which involves moving from a major triad to its relative minor, can be seen as a reflection of the "leading-tone" function in Schenkerian analysis.  (See, for example,  Caplin, 2000). 

* **Influence on Contemporary Music Theory:** Neo-Riemannian theory has influenced contemporary music theory, particularly in the study of chromaticism and non-tonal music. It has helped to develop new analytical tools and frameworks for understanding music that doesn't adhere to traditional tonal structures.  For example, neo-Riemannian theory has been used to analyze the music of composers like Debussy and Schoenberg, who often employed chromaticism and non-tonal elements in their works.  (See, for example,  Cook, 2005).
