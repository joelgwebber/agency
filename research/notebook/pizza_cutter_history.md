The modern pizza cutter, with its circular blade and handle, first appeared in the early 20th century. It was designed to effortlessly glide through the crust and toppings, ensuring clean and even slices. While the exact inventor remains unknown, several patents were filed for pizza cutters during this time period. One notable patent was awarded to Samuel W. Malin in 1892 for a device called a “cutting wheel,” which bears a striking resemblance to the pizza cutters we use today. 

The transition from knives to wheels marked a significant evolution in pizza cutting. The circular blade of the pizza cutter allowed for smooth and effortless cutting, resulting in clean slices that maintained the integrity of the toppings. This innovation revolutionized the way pizzas were prepared and served, making it easier for both professional pizzaiolos and home cooks to create perfectly sliced pizzas. 

During World War II, American soldiers stationed in Italy developed a taste for pizza and brought their newfound love for the dish back home. As the popularity of pizza grew in the United States, so did the demand for efficient pizza-cutting tools. The spread of pizza culture across America during this time played a significant role in the increased adoption of pizza cutters. 

The widespread availability and use of pizza cutters contributed to the standardization of pizza preparation methods. It became an essential tool in pizzerias, allowing for faster service and consistent portioning. With the rise of frozen pizzas and the convenience of at-home pizza baking, pizza cutters became a staple utensil in kitchens worldwide. Today, you can find pizza cutters in various designs, sizes, and materials, catering to different preferences and needs.
